# TF2-Agent-GettingStarted
Just trying to get some stuff up and running with the tensorflow 2 agents

Cartpole seemed to work with DQN
I expected Atari-ram games to be doable but there have been a lot of errors to sort out

I need to add a dependencies file in the future. Currently this just runs on my desktop... 

Current wall : 'AtariEnv' object has no attribute 'game_over'

Things to do : 
Maybe getting this running locally will help point out where my problem is?
